I am a doctoral candidate at the School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University. My research focuses on mathematical sciences and Bayesian statistics, with applications to large-scale dynamic systems. My PhD work particularly explores the use of Particle Filters for state-estimating these systems.

I have a strong interest in programming, and science has continually offered me surprising opportunities. Throughout my Bachelor's and Master's studies, I explored diverse fields such as geothermal well drilling, thermal solar systems, predictive modelling for wind turbines, and applications involving Piecewise Deterministic Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
