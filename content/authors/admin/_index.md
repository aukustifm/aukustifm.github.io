I am a 2nd-year doctoral candidate at the School of Chemical Engineering, Aalto University. My research field interests include mathematical sciences and Bayesian statistics, with applications to stochastic modelling of renewable energy and biological systems. 

I am very interested in programming, but science has been always full of surprises for me and I have always welcomed exploring options during both my Bachelor's and Master's. Some of the options were drilling of geothermal wells, thermal solar systems, predictive modelling for wind turbines and, most recently, applications of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
